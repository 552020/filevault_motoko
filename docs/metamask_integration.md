## üîë MetaMask Authentication on ICP: Current Landscape

The Internet Computer doesn't natively support Ethereum-based wallets like MetaMask due to its unique identity system. However, developers have devised methods to integrate MetaMask authentication by verifying Ethereum signatures within ICP canisters.

### üîß Approaches to Integrate MetaMask Authentication

1. **Using Rust Canisters for ECDSA Verification**: (04/2024)

   - The [icp-eth-starter](https://github.com/dfinity/icp-eth-starter) project demonstrates how to verify Ethereum signatures using Rust canisters.
   - This method leverages the `ethers-core` Rust package to handle ECDSA signature verification.([github.com][1], [forum.dfinity.org][2])

2. **Utilizing Motoko Libraries**:

   - The `evm-txs.mo` library offers functions like `getRecoveryId()` to assist in verifying ECDSA signatures in Motoko.
   - Note: This library is still under development and hasn't undergone a security audit, so exercise caution when using it in production environments.([forum.dfinity.org][2])

3. **Employing MetaMask Snaps**:

   - MetaMask Snaps allow for extending MetaMask's functionality to support non-EVM chains like ICP.
   - Projects like MSQ have explored this avenue, though some users have reported connectivity issues.([forum.dfinity.org][3])

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Implementation Steps

To integrate MetaMask authentication into your ICP application, consider the following steps:

1. **Frontend Integration**:

   - Prompt users to connect their MetaMask wallet.
   - Request a signature of a predefined message to prove ownership of the Ethereum address.([forum.dfinity.org][3], [forum.dfinity.org][4])

2. **Backend Verification**:

   - Send the signed message and the user's Ethereum address to your ICP canister.
   - Within the canister, verify the signature to authenticate the user.([forum.dfinity.org][2], [forum.dfinity.org][4])

3. **Mapping Ethereum Addresses to ICP Principals**:

   - Establish a mapping between Ethereum addresses and ICP principals to manage user identities within your application.

## üìö Additional Resources

- **ICP Documentation on Ethereum Integration**:

  - The official ICP documentation provides insights into integrating with Ethereum networks using the EVM RPC canister.
  - [Using the EVM RPC Canister](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/tutorials/developer-liftoff/level-5/5.2-ICP-ETH-tutorial)([internetcomputer.org][5])

- **Community Discussions**:

  - Engage with the developer community on the [DFINITY Developer Forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/) to stay updated on best practices and emerging solutions.

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

Given the complexity and evolving nature of integrating MetaMask authentication with ICP, it's advisable to:

- Start with a prototype using the Rust-based approach for signature verification, as it currently offers a more robust solution.
- Monitor developments in the Motoko ecosystem for more native solutions in the future.
- Engage with the community to share insights and gather feedback on your implementation.

## üÜï Additional Possibilities and Recommendations (ICP Docs AI Comparison)

### ‚úÖ New Useful Info from ICP Docs AI

1. **MSQ (MetaMask Snap for ICP)**

   - MSQ allows using MetaMask inside ICP through Snaps (MetaMask's plugin system).
   - This could make signature verification and identity mapping smoother by integrating more deeply with MetaMask UI.
   - Note: Snaps require users to install them and are still an emerging technology.

2. **SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum) Standard**

   - SIWE is a widely adopted, wallet-agnostic Web3 login standard.
   - Using SIWE means you ask the user to sign a standard-formatted message with MetaMask, then the backend verifies the signature and maps the Ethereum address to a user identity.
   - Example project: [ic-siwe-react-demo-rust](https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-siwe-react-demo-rust)

3. **FoxIC Project**

   - FoxIC is another real project demonstrating Ethereum key-based signing for ICP actions (sending ICP transactions, wallet interactions, etc).
   - It can serve as reference code for signature handling.

4. **Clear Listing of Three Concrete Paths**
   - **MSQ**
   - **SIWE**
   - **Direct custom ECDSA signature verification (like FoxIC or icp-eth-starter)**
