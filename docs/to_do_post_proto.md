Here’s a realistic and production-oriented **TODO list for after your fast prototype phase**, assuming your goal is a usable, scalable, and secure ICP file-sharing app:

---

## ✅ Post-Prototype TODO List (For Production Readiness)

### 1. **Persistence and Canister Upgrades**

- [ ] Implement `preupgrade` and `postupgrade` hooks to prevent data loss on upgrades.
- [ ] Write serialization/deserialization logic for your file storage (`files` HashMap).
- [ ] Test upgrades with existing user data.

---

### 2. **Client-Side Encryption**

- [ ] Encrypt files on the frontend before upload (e.g., AES, WebCrypto API).
- [ ] Securely manage and share decryption keys (out-of-band or via ICP identity features).
- [ ] Optionally implement recipient-specific encryption for shared files.

---

### 3. **Access Control and Sharing**

- [ ] Implement user-to-user file sharing (define file ownership vs shared access).
- [ ] Add support for setting permissions: (owner-only / shared / public link).
- [ ] Add optional link-based sharing with limited-time or limited-download access.

---

### 4. **Scalability (Memory and File Size)**

- [ ] Implement pagination or streaming queries for listing files.
- [ ] Implement streaming or chunked download API for large files.
- [ ] Add file size limits per user to prevent storage abuse.
- [ ] Plan for storage across multiple canisters (multi-canister storage architecture).
- [ ] Explore integration with off-chain storage if file size becomes a bottleneck.

---

### 5. **User Authentication**

- [ ] Fully integrate Internet Identity for user authentication.
- [ ] Support session management on the frontend (e.g., remember login).

---

### 6. **Frontend UX Improvements**

- [ ] Build a simple but functional web frontend (React, Vue, or plain JS).
- [ ] Implement drag & drop file uploads.
- [ ] Show upload progress per chunk.
- [ ] Implement download buttons with file type handling.

---

### 7. **Error Handling and Validation**

- [ ] Validate file types and sizes client-side.
- [ ] Add backend-side guards for file limits per user or per upload.
- [ ] Implement proper error responses from backend (file not found, unauthorized access, etc).

---

### 8. **Metrics and Logging**

- [ ] Add canister-level metrics: total files, storage used, number of users.
- [ ] Add API call logging for debugging and audit.

---

### 9. **Testing**

- [ ] Unit tests for canister logic.
- [ ] Integration tests for file upload/download.
- [ ] Frontend UI tests for critical flows (upload, list, download).

---

### 10. **Deployment Readiness**

- [ ] Move from local replica to mainnet or boundary subnet deployment.
- [ ] Acquire and manage Cycles for production environment.
- [ ] Set up monitoring (e.g., IC dashboard, custom canister monitoring).

---

### 11. **Optional Nice-to-Haves (Post-MVP)**

- [ ] File deduplication / compression for storage efficiency.
- [ ] Support for resumable uploads.
- [ ] Notifications (email/webhooks) when shared files are accessed.
- [ ] Mobile-friendly frontend.
- [ ] Optional Web3 identity support (FIDO, WebAuthn alternatives).

If you want, I can help generate a GitHub issue tracker-style version of this, or help write code for any of these steps when you’re ready. Want that?
